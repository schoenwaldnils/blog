At some point everyone needs to plunge into the first step. This it is; the beginning of my illustrious blogging career.
Well, joking aside.

## So what awaits you as a reader?

I'm a frontend-developer based in [Hamburg][hamburg] and am going to write here about my interests in this field. These mainly include CSS, CSS animation, SCSS, PostCSS and dalliance with it on [codepen.io][codepen].

Also very interesting and important, I find the area of ​​UX (user experience). Especially in terms of the mobile sector. There, little changes can cause large improvements.

In general, I appreciate neat, clean code (well, who doesn't?)

I don't see myself as a gifted penpusher, but I'll try to convey the thoughts understandable.

So you can look forward to interesting articles.

Enough said.

End of line.
