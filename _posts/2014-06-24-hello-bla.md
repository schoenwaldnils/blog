At some point everyone needs to plunge into the first step. This it is; the beginning of my illustrious blogging career.
Well, joking aside.

## So what awaits you as a reader?

I'm a frontend-developer based in hamburg and am going to write here about my interests in this field. These mainly include CSS, CSS animation, Sass and dalliance with it on [codepen.io][codepen].
To this, the beloved WordPress joins.

Also very interesting and important, I find the area of ​​UX (user experience). Especially in terms of the mobile sector. There, little changes can cause large improvements.

In general, I appreciate neat, clean code (well, who does not?)

I think I’m not a gifted penpusher, but I will try to convey the thoughts understandable.

So you can look forward to interesting articles.

Enough said.

End of line.
